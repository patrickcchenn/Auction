# EATLEVATE
#### Video Demo:  <https://youtu.be/CpGBcY6fF6c>
#### Description:
So Eatlevate is an app useful to keep track/plan your diet.
Currently, Eatlevate have 2 features which is Diet planner and meal planner.
Upon opening the app for the first time, users are prompted with a form asking for user's data(for calculation) which they can save it so it wouldn't reprompt.(activity:mainActivity)
After the data is submitted,another activity will appear(Menu) that users can choose the features this app provide. The "OUT" button serves as a way for the app to forget and reprompted for users data.
Next, the diet plan button, which calculate how much should you eat in order to achieve your goal(gain weight or lose weight or mantain) that we make.
On the other hand, the meal plan method function as a planner so u can keep track and plan for your meal.You can create as many diet plan as you want and edit as much as you like and delete it as we store your data in our database(firebase),
(NOTE:I also included notification feature where you will be notify based on the time you set on your meal. BUT,I am unable to test it since the android phone that I have is not compatible(old)to implement it(as all of my code gradles are the newest(up to date)) and my laptop is too slow to even open an emulator android studio have provided.
So I comment it out from my code(it's on "NewTaskAct.java") but you guys could try this feature if you guys want to by just uncomment it)

### Just wanted to share this here but it's unrelated with the app:
I've actually tried and learn to use REST API to implement a feature where it would generate a meal plan based on calories you would like to intake.
But the problem is that I'm late to realize that this service is paid since i've learn the basic on how to use REST API on android studio.
Then, I search for another relevant API services to this, and I found out a good one which let you to generate random meals for a week and this time its free.
BUT, the problem with this is it's not REST API but it's GraphQL. And in order to use GraphQL on Android Studio, I've to use ApolloGraphQL.
So I've search for tutorial on implementing GraphQL on Android Studio but unfortunately there is little to none of them and the only way to learn this is through reading GitHub Docs both of GraphlQL and Apollo.
I've tried to read and learn them for days before I've came into realize that it is not feasible for a person with this level of experience.
Therefore,I've given up on using API on this app and implement another method. To be frank, Im not that proud with this project with this kind of features/presentation but my thought says that I should be better to move on from this project since it's unproductive compared to taking another cs50s courses that awaits me.
Alright that's all thankyou if you've read this far.

# Enjoy Using this App, and this was Eatlevate.
